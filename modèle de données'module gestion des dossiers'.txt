## Important Business Rules

1. File Reassignment:
- A file can only be assigned to one employee at a time
- Upon reassignment:
* The 'owner' field of the File is updated
* A new ProcessingFile record is created with action='reassign'
* The history keeps track of the previous assignee

2. Processing Workflow:
- Any status change must create a ProcessingFile record
- The 'status' field of the File must always reflect the current status

3. Full History:
- All actions on a file are tracked via ProcessingFile
- Allows you to reconstruct the complete path of a file

4. Documents:
- A file can contain one or more documents
- Documents are automatically deleted if the file is deleted

5. Archiving:
- A file cannot be archived Only once
- After archiving, the status changes to 'archived'

- **Sections to add**:
- **Files** (Current management)
- **Archives** (Viewing classified files)
